        <h3>It’s so very English</h3>
        <p>Suki Waterhouse is constantly traveling for fashion campaigns, film shoots, and concert tours, so she wanted her West London flat to truly feel like a home. The English multihyphenate added warmth to the historic apartment, which she purchased for its huge windows and natural light, with a deep green Devol kitchen and rare reclaimed floorboards. She then enlisted designer Izzy Hamilton-Fairley of IHF Interiors to furnish the place with vintage treasures and patterned textiles.<br>On the open-plan top level of the duplex, the women opted for a classic midcentury look. The orange, purple, and charcoal palette was informed by a geometric area rug Suki already owned. Izzy managed to find a floral Penny Morrison fabric in the same exact hues, which she used to craft curtains and throw pillows. She completed the living area with a set of vintage cowhide seats, two linen Theodore armchairs from Soho Home, and a custom bouclé sofa.<br>“I loved the idea of a boudoir-esque vibe in the bedroom, bathroom, and dressing room, with old antique lamps and chandeliers, vintage furniture, and fabrics,” Suki shares.</p>

        <h3>We’re green with envy</h3>
        <p>“I really didn’t have any other parameters other than prewar,” says Kayla Dalle Molle, collection specialist at the MoMA, of her hunt to find her next home. On a Bed-Stuy street sat an 1892 brownstone with the sort of iconic period details any history buff or design lover would fawn over. But the hand-carved crown moldings and 10-foot ceilings weren’t the only reason the art researcher felt drawn to the space. “I knew what Manhattan had to offer, and I knew what I could afford,” Kayla says of the harsh reality of New York City real estate.<br>Accomplishing what many art aficionados crave but rarely master, Kayla’s Brooklyn abode feels more like a lived-in gallery than an 800-square-foot apartment. But don’t be fooled: Her home is not a place for snobbery. “There’s a no-shoes rule, but that’s it,” a valid ask for living in a city as vibrant as New York. “You can create warmth and comfort and not sacrifice on great-looking art—the two are not mutually exclusive,” she comments on the approachable nature of the space. She credits her plants for providing such an inviting feel. Sitting comfortably in an array of self-watering pots rest 30-plus indoor plants all contributing to the relaxed air encompassing the space.</p>

        <h3>Gothic House in the Woods</h3>
        <p>As the artist Zola Jesus, Nika Roza Danilova makes dark and atmospheric vibes pop propelled by deep ruminations around stillness and absence. So, when the 33-year-old singer, songwriter, and producer set out to design a home from scratch in 2015, her instinct was to erect a minimalist “black metal square” in the northwoods of Wisconsin.<br>Though the decision shocked local contractors, Nika pressed forward with her plan to build a “2001: A Space Odyssey monolith,” as she puts it, on the 150 acre property where she originally grew up with her family. “It’s really healing for me to be in spaces that are very clean and simple,” she explains. “There’s also something I like about brutalism in nature. Nature is so organic, and the woods are curvy, and then seeing this black box that’s so deeply human… That contrast is so much more interesting.”<br>With help from her uncles (one a builder, another an electrician) and her carpenter dad, the loft-style property was eventually finished in 2017. The home—where she now resides with her fiancé, their black German shepherd named Nadja, and a gray tuxedo cat named Kosha—is now a respite when she returns from touring and traveling across the globe.</p>
